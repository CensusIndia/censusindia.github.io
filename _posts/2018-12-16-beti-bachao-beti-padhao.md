## About Campaign: 

The government of India launched a campaign with the initial investment of 100 Crore INR (US$14 million) to generate awareness and improve the efficiency of welfare services intended for girls. It mainly targets the six states of India i.e._Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Bihar, and Delhi_.

## Why this Campaign:

According to census data, the child gender ratio in India was 927 girls per 1,000 boys in 2001, which dropped to 918 girls for every 1,000 boys in 2011. A 2012 UNICEF report ranked India 41st among 195 countries. In the Population Census of 2011, it was revealed that the population ratio of India 2011 is 943 females per 1000 of males. The Sex Ratio 2011 shows an upward trend from the census 2001 data. Thus, this campaign was launched on 22 January 2015 by Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi to address this issue. 

## But Few key points: 
  
1. **What were the criteria to select those 6 states?** There are many other states having a worse situation than these states. As per the census data 2011, states like Rajasthan(888), J&K(889), Gujarat(890), Maharastra(894) having less sex ratio index than the states selected for the campaign. 
I can understand there could be many reasons like state government support to centre, insignificant total population etc. But, I think there should be more big good reasons behind this. It will interesting to know those reationale behind this.


| State name       | Child Sex ratio  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| **Haryana** | 834 |
| **Punjab** | 846 |
| **NCT of Delhi** | 871 |
|Rajasthan | 888|
|J&K | 889|
|**Uttarakhand** | 890 |
| Gujarat | 890 |
| Maharastra | 894 |
| **UP** | 902 |
| **Bihar**      | 935 | 

_Campaign launched in **Highlighted states.**_


2. **Surprisingly, In most of the highly populated states, towns have lesser sex ratio index than Villages**. Is it because foeticide is less in the village due to less technological advancement? I think this can be a good finding to help in selecting potential areas for such campaigns and deciding policies to solve the issues.
